This project takes what I have learned thus far in my three years of schooling and two years of industry learning. It involves embedded systems (with the poker chip scale), IoT (wifi communication), computer vision learning, and small data (sqlite). The conglomeration of these topics will produce (hopefully) an interactive system to enhance annual Thanksgiving poker games.

Mastermind glasses were created by my brother (Joseph Krueger) during his IoT course. This project extends what he and Aiden Schulze created by building an ecosystem of devices to interact with the glasses. Hope

# Pages
I intend to create a Python web-application using Plotly Dash, as it is the primary tool I use at work for dashboarding. There are limitations, but the syntax is easy.

## Home

Landing page and access to starting a new game. I also want to incorporate some form of registration (and verification of players not being randoms). Building an accompying mobile application would be beneficial for this.
